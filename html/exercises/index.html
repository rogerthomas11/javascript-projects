    <h1>Why I Love Web Development</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>I love solving problems</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the creativity it lets me express</li>
      <li>I have a lot fun building things and it's rewarding to see a development project come together</li>
    </ol>

    <p>When it comes websites I think firstly I would like to make a really nice portfolio site. 
      Something clean and well designed that looks great on a browser and on mobile. If I had to 
      choose a passion project right now I think that it would be really cool to create an NHL stats tracker.
      I think it would be a great challenge and a way to expand my skills as a developer.</p>
